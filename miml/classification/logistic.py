    Logistic Regression

    Logistic regression (logit model) is a generalized linear model used for binomial regression. 
    Logistic regression applies maximum likelihood estimation after transforming the dependent into 
    a logit variable. A logit is the natural log of the odds of the dependent equaling a certain 
    value or not (usually 1 in binary logistic models, the highest value in multinomial models). 
    In this way, logistic regression estimates the odds of a certain event (value) occurring.
    
    :param x: (*array*) Training samples. 2D array.
    :param y: (*array*) Training labels in [0, c), where c is the number of classes.
    :param L: (*float*) Lambda - Î» > 0 gives a "regularized" estimate of linear weights which often 
        has superior generalization performance, especially when the dimensionality is high.
    :param tol: (*float*) The tolerance for stopping iterations.
    :param max_iter: (*int*) Maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge.
