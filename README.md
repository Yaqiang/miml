mimlï¼šMeteoInfo machine learning toolbox based on Smile and Encog
=================================================================

Installation
------------

Copy miml folder into MeteoInfo -> toolbox folder.

Features
--------

Machine learning algorithms of classification, regression, clustering based on [Smile](https://haifengl.github.io/smile/),
and neural network model based on [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/).

Example
-------

K-Means clustering:

    from miml import datasets
    from miml.cluster import KMeans

    fn = os.path.join(datasets.get_data_home(), 'clustering', 'gaussian', 
        'six.txt')
    df = DataFrame.read_table(fn, header=None, names=['x1','x2'], 
        format='%2f')
    x = df.values
    clusters = KMeans(x, 6, runs=20)
    y = clusters.get_cluster_label()

    scatter(x[:,0], x[:,1], c=y, edgecolor=None, s=3)
